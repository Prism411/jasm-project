# JASM (JAVA ASSEMBLY SIMULATOR) 
## About the Project:
JASM, the assembly environment simulator developed by Jader Louis Nicolas Sales and Wyllgner França, is a powerful tool designed to aid students and researchers in the field of computer science. This software is being primarily focused on educational purposes, 
and it allows users to simulate assembly language programming in a safe and controlled environment.
## Usage: JASM's educational focus is evident in the design of its features. The simulator has been developed with the aim of making assembly language programming accessible to learners of all levels. Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation make it easy for novices to get started, while its advanced features provide experienced users with the tools they need to tackle more complex programming challenges.
In addition to its educational benefits, JASM has a range of practical applications. It can be used to develop low-level system software, such as device drivers and operating systems. It is also a useful tool for researchers and engineers who need to analyze the performance of computer systems at the assembly language level.
Overall, JASM is a powerful and versatile tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way assembly language programming is taught and practiced. Its user-friendly interface, comprehensive documentation, and advanced features make it an ideal tool for students, researchers, and professionals alike.
## How it works: The simulator is built upon an operating system platform and offers a range of features that enable users to write, compile, and execute assembly language programs. With JASM, users can experiment with different programming constructs, debug errors and analyze the behavior of the programs they write. The simulator also provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to interact with the code and see its results in real-time.
